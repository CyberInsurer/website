You should never ever have to spend more than 10 minutes talking to insurance people, we're really boring!

Cyber Insurer UK is on a mission to make buying business cyber insurance quick, simple and pain free, so that busy people running businesses can concentrate on the big stuff, the exciting stuff and their customers and not the tedious stuff like insurance. 

We thought we could make insurance interesting, but we couldn't so we've made it painless!

If your a business with less than £2.5m in turnover we can have you covered in under five minutes, you can pay monthly with no interest or hidden charges and if you ever need to leave us it just takes two clicks and you're done. If the worst happens and you need to make a claim we do this all over the phone to help you as quickly as we can.

All documents and paperwork are stored online and available in your dashboard at anytime.

So, we're going to be safe and boring, so you don't have to be!
