Can you afford to gamble with your business?\n\n## Most common types of attacks\n\nIn the majority of cases 'hackers' are not targeting spefic companies with their malware. They don't have a 'hit list'. They deploy their viruses out onto the internet and let them roam the internet looking for open doors into a company's network. Anyone could be a victim.\n\nThe most common type of cyber attack involves fraudulent emails, with the survey (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/702074/Cyber_Security_Breaches_Survey_2018_-_Main_Report.pdf)finding that that loss of files or data, software corruption, and theft of money, assets, or intellectual property were the most common result of such attacks.\n\nIt’s headline news. And it’s businesses of all sizes.  With data-led startups often relying on and trading in data (everyone has heard the expression ‘data is the new oil’), data breaches and data loss are now frequently making headline news. The [WannaCry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack) malware, for example, recently brought the NHS system to its knees, making headline news as it affected computers across the world.\n\nAnd while the NHS and government might be popular targets for cyber criminals, smaller businesses, who might have more lax security policies, are much softer targets.  Among SMEs and entrepreneurial businesses, certain types of business are more susceptible to attack.\n\nThe public sector remains a primary target for such attacks, though companies within the information sector, particularly those of a smaller size, are almost among the most common sources of a data breach (https://enterprise.verizon.com/verizon-insights-lab/dbir/tool/#IndustriesSection).\n\n\n## Do I need cyber insurance?\n\nDon’t allow your business to be the latest in 2019’s list of major data breaches.\nGet a quote for cyber insurance today.
