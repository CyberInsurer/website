Whereas insurance used to be primarily focussed on assets and liability, remote working, cloud-based software, and the world of work in the 21st century means that insurance needs are rapidly changing. \n\n## Protecting your data, your assets, and your company\nThe infrastructure, hardware and software we all take for granted is subject to a huge array of threats from various sources. Some of these are well-known, however hackers and those with intent now have dozens of avenues of attack. We’ve listed the most common below. \n### Internet fraud/theft\nCifas reported that 2017 saw the highest ever level of identity fraud reported by its members. It’s a global problem, with the FBI reporting over 300,000 complaints of internet fraud, including financial fraud in 2017.\n\nOne of the most common ways that this occurs is through password attacks. Passwords are still the simplest form of online security used, and often overlooked. Attacks can be automated (often by ‘brute force’, computers rapidly testing thousands of passwords per second), or simple human error such as using weak passwords or physically writing down passwords for easy theft.\n### Extortion\nYour business is no doubt your lifeblood, and cyber criminals know this. While crimes against individuals often involve credit card numbers or bank details, cyber criminals are increasingly withholding critical business information, or even information technology assets to ransom. Typically, data, or accounts will be locked until a fee is paid, with the threat of information being leaked or deleted unless payment is received. \nThese payments are often anonymously accepted through means such as cryptocurrencies, making it almost impossible to trace back to the extorter.\n### Viruses, Denial-of-service attacks, Malware\nOne of the most common cyber crimes is the distribution of viruses, malware, and other types of software which can disrupt, damage, or take hold of your hardware or software. Malware can be sneakily installed on computers through a rogue click of a banner ad, or more systematically via USB drives. Once a computer is infected, it can be controlled remotely, or leak information without the user knowing.\n\n### Phishing\nPhishing attacks can and do happen to anyone. A simple email from your bank or third party provider. Except it’s not from who you think, it just looks like it is. And before you know it, your personal details are sent off. \n\nThis can be compounded with your personal data then being extorted. Phishing is one of the largest growing areas of cyber security, with all of us still reliant on email, and some phishing attacks looking virtually identical to a genuine email we might receive from a provider.\n### Man-in-the-Middle attacks\nThese can come about when accessing free/public wi-fi hotspots. If a connection isn’t secured, sensitive[EC1] data is easily obtainable and can be intercepted by criminals. This can be made worse if malware is then installed on the target computer, collecting sensitive data. This data can then be used to steal further data, or used in a phishing attack, often without any knowledge of the target. Once cyber criminals are in your network they have a myriad of options of how to damage your business.\n\n## Is your business covered?  \n### EC to provide input here###\nIf you’re unsure about whether or not your business is safe from the threat of phishing, or if the legal ramifications of data loss has you worried about how you will have to respond, it’s likely that your business could benefit from cyber insurance.
