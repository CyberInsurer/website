Cyber Insurer UK offers an innovative policy to cover your business, and to you ensure that your business is safe from the ramifications of a cyber attack or data breach, we’ve broken down the costs involved.\n\n## The cost of a cyber attack on your business\n\nThe average cost of a data breach to an SME is estimated to be £75k. \nThe cost of our policies starts at £29.99. Can your business afford to take the risk?\nCyber attacks don’t just impact lost or stolen data, or hardware. There’s financial costs - downtime, equipment replacement costs, disruption to trading, legal implications (see more on GDPR, below), and crucially, reputational damage. Consumers are becoming more savvy to what businesses are using their personal data for, and for a data-driven organisation to experience a cyber attack could be crippling from a customer trust perspective.\n\n## GDPR & the 4%/£20,000,000 fine\n\nThe set of EU regulations known as General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which came into force in May 2018, has greatly increased the knock-on effect that a data breach can have on a business - of any size.\n\nThe regulations replaced the outdated Data Protection Act of 1998 which didn’t considered the rising tide of cyber attacks from 2000 onwards. One of the main features of the new regulations is the increase in fines which can be imposed on businesses responsible for data breaches or poorly handed personal data to up to £20,000,000, or 4% of a companies annual turnover, which would be crippling to an SME or startup business.\n\nThose thinking that fines won’t happen can think again - as in January 2019, Google was fined more than €50million for violating data privacy rules. It is widely expected that the effect will trickle down from larger corporations to smaller sized companies, with the number of complaints to the ICO rising 160% in the first 6 months since GDPR launched.\n\n## Average cost of cyber insurance\n\nThe level of cover from a cyber insurance policy can be many thousands of times the policy cost, giving you and your business ultimate peace of mind.\n\nWith cyber insurance an emerging product, many policies from non-specialist providers are not bespoke to your business, so provide levels of cover which are either insufficient or are excessive. The cover offered by these policies will be reflected in the price, so never choose your policy based on price.\n\nCyber Insurer UK can provide you with a quote in just 60 seconds, which is crucially - matched to the size and level of covered required to protect your business.\nOur policies are available for as little as £29.99, with cover for our basic policies including/covering\n\nIf you’d like to know more about the types of attack which cyber insurance can protect from, read our post here for more information on cyber insurance.\n"},"cover":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/327toh44mjqi/RSRupsULZPQOwU6XvHVyf/ad78eb698b99c1bfe36ad2273a38d6d7/carlos-muza-84523-unsplash.jpg","fileName":"carlos-muza-84523-unsplash.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"how-much-does-cyber-insurance-cost","id":"97e2c183-b893-5c07-8d0a-b7beeb58c08f"}}
